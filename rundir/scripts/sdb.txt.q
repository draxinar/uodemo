"It is good to have you back sir, but I have done all I can for thee, it is now up to you to save our village."
"Hello again! Have you found a smith's hammer for me yet?  I can't make that sword without it!"
"Greetings my friend, have you brought me a longsword?"
"Greetings again, sir.  Have you had any luck on your quest?"
"Ah, a guest in my home, greetings my friend!"
"The dragon won't be a problem after I make you an enchanted sword, but I need a smith's hammer to do so."
"The dragon won't be a problem after I make you an enchanted sword, but I need an ordinary longsword to do so."
"With the sword I gave you, you should be able to kill the dragon, perhaps in a single blow!"
"Ahh, a young dragonslayer are you?  Well you will need help.  Bring me a smith's hammer, and I can make you an enchanted sword to slay the beast with!"
"hammer"
"You should be able to get a smith's hammer from the blacksmith in town for a modest price."
"longsword"
"You should be able to get a longsword from the blacksmith in town for a modest price."
"Well, if you got bored, you could always go slay that cursed dragon!"
"assistance"
"The sword I gave you is all the help I can render you."
"What was it you needed help with?"
"glass"
"enchanted"
"Given a smith's hammer and an ordinary longsword, I can make an enchanted sword!"
"I'll need a regular longsword to make an enchanted sword of."
"That sword does potent damage, but has very limited use."
"I can make an enchanted sword, but I'll need a smith's hammer and an ordinary longsword to do so."
"I have already made you a glass sword, that is all I can do for you."
"Yes, with this I can make you an enchanted sword to slay the dragon with!  All I need now is your longsword... you do have one don't you?"
"Good, now I will make your glass sword.  Remember you can only use it once, and I can not make another!"
"glasssword"
"The sage chants for a moment, and hits your longsword with the hammer shattering the steel and revealing a blade of glass!"
"I can make an enchanted sword from this, but I still need a hammer."
