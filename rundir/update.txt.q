We are ready to continue the implementation of the Reputation System.
Today is the second phase of the process, which is publishing to a single
server.  We will be updating the Great Lakes Shard at 2:00 CST today.  We
will be monitoring this server closely throughout the day.  If everything
runs normally, we will continue to the third phase of the process on
Thursday by updating the remaining public servers.
